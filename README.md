# Command-Line ToDoList Application  

Welcome to my self-taught PHP project!  
I created this application to learn how PHP works and to study the various errors that can occur in a project. This is not a legitimate application and can only be used in the terminal. To run it, use the command "php app.php". Once again, this is not ideal. I built this project with only basic PHP knowledge, without involving any other languages, such as front-end technologies.

## Features

- Add tasks to your to-do list
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks from the list
- View all tasks in your to-do list

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/studi-kasus-todolist.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd studi-kasus-todolist
    ```

## Usage
